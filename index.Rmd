## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the Latino Vote. I am currently a fellow for Voto Latino and they do a lot of research on the Latino vote. I think it would be really cool to do my final project on the Latino vote while working with Voto Latino. Voto Latino will be an excellent resource for this project. I will probably focus on voter suppression or misinformation. I look forward to be able to do my project on a topic I am so passionate about.
